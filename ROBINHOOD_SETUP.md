# Robinhood Position Fetcher - READ ONLY

This integration fetches your current stock positions from Robinhood.

## What It Does ✓

- Fetches tickers of stocks you currently own
- Shows entry prices (average buy price)
- Shows current prices and unrealized P/L %
- Shows number of shares

## What It Does NOT Do ✗

- Does NOT read account balance
- Does NOT read portfolio value
- Does NOT read buying power or cash
- Does NOT execute any trades
- Does NOT modify any positions
- Does NOT place any orders

**This is READ-ONLY for position tracking.**

---

## Setup

### 1. Install Library

```bash
pip install robin-stocks
```

This library provides API access to Robinhood (read-only mode).

### 2. Set Environment Variables

Add to your `.env` file (or export in terminal):

```bash
ROBINHOOD_USERNAME=your_email@example.com
ROBINHOOD_PASSWORD=your_password
```

If you have 2FA enabled (recommended):

```bash
ROBINHOOD_MFA_CODE=123456  # Optional - can also enter interactively
```

**Security note**: Never commit your `.env` file to Git. It's already in `.gitignore`.

---

## Usage

### Quick Check - See Your Positions

```bash
python check_positions.py
```

This will:
1. Log in to Robinhood (will prompt for MFA if enabled)
2. Fetch your current positions
3. Display formatted report:
   - Ticker
   - Number of shares
   - Entry price
   - Current price
   - Unrealized P/L %
4. Option to export to text file
5. Auto-logout

## Use Cases

### 1. Check Before Scanner Runs

See what you already own so you don't get duplicate buy signals:

```python
from src.data.robinhood_positions import RobinhoodPositionFetcher

fetcher = RobinhoodPositionFetcher()
fetcher.login()

owned_tickers = fetcher.get_position_tickers()
print(f"Currently own: {owned_tickers}")

fetcher.logout()
```

### 2. Compare Scanner Signals to Current Holdings

```python
# Get your positions
current_positions = fetcher.fetch_positions()

# Get scanner buy signals
buy_signals = [...]  # From scanner

# Filter out stocks you already own
new_opportunities = [
    signal for signal in buy_signals
    if signal['ticker'] not in [p['ticker'] for p in current_positions]
]
```

### 3. Auto-Update Trade Tracker

Fetch your positions and compare to your spreadsheet to find:
- Positions you forgot to log
- Exit prices when you've sold
- Current unrealized P/L

---

## Security

### Best Practices

1. **Use 2FA**: Enable two-factor authentication on Robinhood
2. **Environment variables**: Never hardcode credentials
3. **Don't commit .env**: Already in `.gitignore`
4. **Read-only**: This integration has NO trading capabilities
5. **Token storage**: robin-stocks stores auth token locally, logout when done

### What Permissions Does This Need?

The robin-stocks library uses your login credentials to access Robinhood's private API (the same API their mobile app uses).

**It can access**:
- Your positions (read-only)
- Historical orders (not implemented here)
- Account details (not accessed by our code)

**It cannot**:
- Place trades without explicit `rh.order_buy_*()` calls (we don't use these)
- Withdraw funds
- Change settings
- Access linked bank accounts

**Our implementation only calls**:
- `rh.login()` - Authenticate
- `rh.get_open_stock_positions()` - Fetch positions
- `rh.get_latest_price()` - Get current prices
- `rh.logout()` - Cleanup

No trading functions are used anywhere in the code.

## Troubleshooting

### "Login failed"

1. Check username/password are correct
2. If using 2FA, make sure MFA code is current (they expire quickly)
3. Try logging into Robinhood web/app to verify credentials work

### "Challenge required"

Robinhood sometimes requires extra verification:
- Log into the web app once
- Complete any security challenges
- Try the script again

### "Too many requests"

Robinhood rate limits API calls:
- Wait a few minutes
- Don't run the script repeatedly in quick succession

### "robin_stocks not found"

```bash
pip install robin-stocks
```

If that fails:
```bash
pip3 install robin-stocks
```

## Position Management - Stop Loss Recommendations

**NEW: Automated stop loss adjustment recommendations**

### Overview

The `manage_positions.py` tool fetches your Robinhood positions and analyzes each one to recommend:
- When to trail your stop losses up
- Exact new stop loss levels with detailed rationale
- When to take partial profits (25-50%)
- Warnings for Phase 3/4 transitions

**Important**: Only analyzes **SHORT-TERM** positions (held <1 year). Long-term positions are excluded to preserve favorable capital gains tax treatment.

### Usage

```bash
python manage_positions.py
```

With entry dates for tax treatment filtering:
```bash
python manage_positions.py --entry-dates entry_dates.json
```

Export report to file:
```bash
python manage_positions.py --export
```

### What It Recommends

**5-10% Gain**: Trail to Breakeven
- Moves stop to entry price (risk-free position)
- "If it pulls back, exit at breakeven with no loss"

**10-20% Gain**: Trail to +5% Profit or 50 SMA
- Locks in minimum 5% profit
- Trails to 50 SMA if it's higher
- "Let winner run while protecting gains"

**20-30% Gain**: Take Partial + Trail Remainder
- Recommends selling 25-30% at current price
- Trail remaining 70-75% with stop at +10% profit
- "Lock in some gains, let runners go"

**30%+ Gain**: Take 50% + Trail Tight
- Recommends selling 50% at current price
- Trail remaining 50% very tight (near 50 SMA)
- "Major winner - secure profits, give last piece tight room"

================================================================================
```

### Entry Dates JSON Format

Create a `entry_dates.json` file to track when you entered each position:

```json
{
  "AAPL": "2024-10-18T00:00:00",
  "MSFT": "2023-05-10T00:00:00",
  "NVDA": "2024-11-13T00:00:00"
}
```

**Why this matters**:
- Positions held 365+ days = Long-term capital gains (15-20% tax)
- Positions held <365 days = Short-term capital gains (ordinary income rate)
- The tool WON'T recommend adjusting stops for long-term positions to avoid triggering early sale

### Technical Analysis Used

Each position is analyzed for:
- Current Phase (1-4 stage analysis)
- 50-day SMA (key support level)
- 200-day SMA (major trend indicator)
- Recent swing lows (last 10 days)
- Distance from entry price

Stop recommendations use:
- Breakeven stops for small winners
- Profit-based stops for medium winners
- SMA-based trailing stops when above 50 SMA
- Tight trailing for big winners (30%+)

## Manual Trading Only

This tool is for **information only**. You still:
- Manually review buy signals
- Manually review stop loss recommendations
- Manually place orders on Robinhood app/web
- Manually adjust stop losses on the platform
- Manually exit positions

The integration provides **recommendations** - you make all trading decisions.
